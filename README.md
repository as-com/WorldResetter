WorldResetter
=============

Who said that only admins could reset the state of a Minecraft world? Now operators can do this "admin" task!

##Download

WorldResetter is not available for download at the moment. However, it will become available as soon as it is ready. You can still watch the changes I make through this Github repository and clone it into Eclipse, Netbeans, and other IDEs.
